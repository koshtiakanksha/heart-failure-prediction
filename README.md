## When Hearts Speak: Harnessing the Power of Data Science to Predict Heart Failure

**Introduction:**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a global health concern, with heart failure being a significant contributor. This project aimed to leverage data science techniques to develop a model for predicting heart failure using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)).

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

* Downloaded and explored the heart failure dataset, identifying data dimensions, data types, and potential missing values.
* Visualizations revealed relationships between features and potential risk factors.
* Outliers in resting blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol were addressed using Winsorization.
* Missing data points were imputed using appropriate techniques.
* Categorical features were transformed for model inclusion through one-hot encoding.
* The data was split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
* Feature scaling (standardization) was applied to numerical features.

**Model Development and Evaluation:**

* Various machine learning algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) were implemented and compared using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
* Model performance was evaluated using F1-score, which prioritizes minimizing false negatives (missed heart failure cases).
* The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest F1-score of 91.8% on the test data, followed by Random Forest (91.1%).
* Logistic Regression and SVM also showed promising results with F1-scores of 89.4% and 88.5% respectively.

**Conclusion:**

This project successfully employed data science techniques to develop a model for predicting heart failure. The Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the most effective algorithm, achieving an F1-score of 91.8% on the test data. Further exploration could involve feature engineering, incorporating additional datasets, and refining model interpretability for better understanding of risk factors. As a responsible use-case, this project highlights the potential of data science in supporting early detection and risk assessment for heart failure.
